/**
 * Example of using Hipster to solve the 8-puzzle search problem problem using the
 * Dijkstra's algorithm.
 * <p>
 * In this example a {@link SearchProblem} is used to define the components of the search, and
 * the search iterator is later instantiated using this structure. This summarizes the content
 * of this example:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Uses {@link SearchProblem}, a structure created to facilitate organizing and storing the components
 *     of the search.</li>
 *     <li>The state of the 8-puzzle problem is modeled as an array. Each position of the array stores the number
 *     of each piece of the puzzle at the given position, meaning the 0 the empty space.</li>
 *     <li>This problem is modeled with actions, so an {@link ActionFunction} is used.
 *     This function analyzes which actions are applicable in each state. Valid actions for this problem are moving the
 *     empty space in each of the following directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.</li>
 *     <li>The {@link es.usc.citius.hipster.model.function.TransitionFunction}
 *     creates the {@link Transition} resulting from apply the given actions to the current state.</li>
 *     <li>The {@link CostFunction} for this problem is unitary. All actions have unitary cost.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The objective of this search problem is to minimize the number of actions to solve the 8-puzzle.
