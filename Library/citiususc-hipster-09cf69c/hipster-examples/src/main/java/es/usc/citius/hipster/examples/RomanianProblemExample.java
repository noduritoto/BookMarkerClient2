/**
 * Example of graph search using the Romania problem described
 * <a href =http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0136042597.pdf>here</a>.
 * <p>
 * This example consists in a search problem based on a {@link es.usc.citius.hipster.graph.HipsterGraph}. Main
 * characteristics of this example are:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>Uses {@link GraphSearchProblem}, a subclass of {@link SearchProblem} specially designed to facilitate
 *      working with graph search problems.</li>
 *      <li>The nodes of the graph are different cities in Romania.</li>
 *      <li>Edges of the graph (connectivity between cities) are defined in the link above.</li>
 *      <li>Graph nodes and edges are defined in {@link es.usc.citius.hipster.util.examples.RomanianProblem}</li>
 *      <li>Finds the shortest path between the cities Arad and Bucharest.</li>
 *      <li>Cost function takes the cost of moving between cities from the arcs of the graph.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Although a heuristic is not used in this example (so A* behaves as Dijkstra's algorithm), it is defined in
 * {@link RomanianProblem#heuristicFunction()}. This heuristic stores the Euclidean Distance between each city and
 * Bucharest.
